# Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Refactoring (current priority)

Rename and reorganize before adding features. No new behavior, just structural clarity.

- [x] Rename repo: `telegram-to-notion` → `notion-pilot`
- [x] Rename Python package: `telegram_to_notion` → `notion_pilot`
- [x] Reorganize into verticals: `crm/`, `inbox/` (from `pipelines/`), `shared/` (adapters, llm, utils, notion.py, config.py, models.py)
- [x] Organize scripts: `scripts/crm/` + `scripts/inbox/`
- [x] Unify People capture through `notion_people_data_source_id` and the central CRM syncer
- [x] Update README, CHANGELOG, brain vault note path

## Phase 0c — Infrastructure: Infisical OIDC Secrets Management

Single source of truth for all secrets. `vault.yml` reduced to 3 Infisical bootstrap vars only. GitHub Actions uses OIDC — zero static GitHub secrets.

**Infisical setup (manual — done by user):**
- [x] Created `cicd-devbox` folder in `prod` env of Dom Universe project with: `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`, `CERTBOT_EMAIL`, `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `TS_OAUTH_SECRET`, `DEVBOX_TAILSCALE_IP`, `DEVBOX_SSH_PORT`, `DEVBOX_SSH_USER`
- [ ] Grant `notion-pilot-ansible` machine identity read access to `prod/cicd-devbox` folder
- [ ] Create `notion-pilot-ci` machine identity — auth: JWT/OIDC, JWKS URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks`, bound subject: `repo:ldom1/telegram-to-notion:ref:refs/heads/main`
- [ ] Assign `notion-pilot-ci` read-only policy on `prod/cicd-devbox` folder
- [ ] Copy `notion-pilot-ci` identity ID (needed in deploy.yml)

**Code changes (notion-pilot-deployment):**
- [ ] `vault.yml` — remove `vault_github_actions_ssh_public_key`, `vault_github_deploy_key`, `vault_certbot_email`
- [ ] New task file `roles/notion_pilot/tasks/fetch_infisical_secrets.yml` — fetch `prod/cicd-devbox` secrets via `uri` module, `set_fact` with `no_log: true`
- [ ] `roles/notion_pilot/tasks/main.yml` — include `fetch_infisical_secrets.yml` before devbox/vps tasks
- [ ] `roles/notion_pilot/tasks/devbox.yml` — replace `vault_github_*` with Infisical facts
- [ ] `roles/notion_pilot/tasks/vps.yml` — replace `vault_certbot_email` with Infisical fact

**Code changes (telegram-to-notion):**
- [ ] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — add `permissions: id-token: write`, add `Infisical/secrets-action` OIDC step, replace all `${{ secrets.* }}` with `${{ env.* }}`
- [ ] Delete GitHub secrets: `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `TS_OAUTH_SECRET`, `DEVBOX_SSH_KEY`

**Documentation:**
- [ ] `resources/knowledge/infrastructure/secrets-management.md` in brain vault

## Phase 1 — Setup Wizard (CLI)

One-command bootstrap on virgin Notion for both products.

- [x] `scripts/inbox/setup_workspace.py` — create Knowledge DBs (Notions, Ideas, Tools, Data & Technology)
- [x] Extend `scripts/crm/setup_workspace.py` to optionally create all 4 DBs in one shot
- [ ] `/setup` Telegram command — guided onboarding wizard that sets up the workspace and outputs `.env` values

## Phase 2 — Email "à relire"

- [x] Email pipeline: scan inbox → classify (newsletter / contact / transactional) via LLM
- [x] Auto-tag newsletters and unread knowledge as `À relire` in Knowledge DB
- [x] Skip already-processed messages (idempotent)

## Phase 2b — Knowledge Triage (in progress)

Batch enrichment script that replicates the Notion agent logic locally (no Notion AI credits needed).

Source: Dom Telegram Bot DB (`NOTION_TELEGRAM_MSG_DATABASE_ID`) — pages with `Status = Not analysed`.
Target: 4 custom knowledge DBs — Notions, Ideas, Tools, Data & Technology.

**Flow:** read source page → LLM identifies subject entity + target DB → find or create meta-page → append dated note section → write summary back → mark `Analysed`.
**Lifecycle:** `--purge` archives `Analysed` source pages older than 14 days.

- [x] `scripts/inbox/enrich_knowledge.py` — batch triage script (dry-run, limit, dedup, purge, JSON output)
- [x] Add to `config/scripts.yaml` for cockpit visibility
- [x] Correct DB IDs in `.env` (page IDs → actual DB IDs for Notions, Tools, Data & Tech)
- [ ] E2E test with `--limit=5` (no dry-run) to validate Notion writes
- [ ] Tune LLM granularity: crypto roundup produces 7 entities — may need a `max_entities_per_page` guard

## Phase 3 — Telegram Recap Commands

- [ ] `/recap` — daily/weekly summary: active deals, unread knowledge items, upcoming next actions
- [ ] `/leads` — list open deals with stage
- [ ] `/inbox` — list Knowledge items tagged `À relire`
- [ ] Scheduled recap (cron or Telegram command)

## Phase 4 — Website & Cockpit (current)

- [ ] Landing page (Astro or Next.js): pitch for notion-crm + notion-inbox, screenshots, CTAs
- [x] "Deploy to Notion" wizard: Notion OAuth → auto-create DBs → display `.env` values
- [x] Cockpit (`/cockpit`): workspace overview, script launcher, LLM chat against CRM data
  - [x] DB cards with live record counts and inline pointer editing (cockpit_config.json)
  - [x] Automation panel: scripts.yaml manifest → one-click run with SSE log output
  - [x] "Ask your data" chat: query CRM → LLM leads → one-click "Add to Notion"
- [ ] Chatbot endpoint (FastAPI): receive text → query Notion DBs → structured response
- [ ] Chatbot UI: embeddable on landing page

## Phase 5 — Multi-customer deployment

> **Decision (2026-06-03):** Hosted wizard + shared Telegram bot + file-upload cockpit. See DECISIONS.md for the full ADR.

**How customers use Notion Pilot (target state):**
1. Customer visits `notion-pilot.com` → OAuth with Notion → workspace created in their account
2. Customer opens the cockpit → runs scripts, chats with data, uploads files
3. Customer clicks "Connect Telegram" → deep link → links their Telegram user ID to their workspace
4. One shared bot handles all customers, dispatches to the right workspace per user

**What needs to be built:**

- [ ] `data/` namespacing by Notion workspace_id — `data/{workspace_id}/crm/`, `data/{workspace_id}/conv_state.db`
- [ ] `/api/cockpit/upload` — file upload for LinkedIn CSV (and future files); stores to `data/{workspace_id}/`
- [ ] Encrypted Notion token storage per workspace (needed to run scripts on the customer's behalf)
- [ ] User registry: `{telegram_user_id → workspace_id}` SQLite table
- [ ] "Connect Telegram" flow in cockpit: generate one-time deep link token → bot maps user on `/start <token>`
- [ ] Bot dispatcher: look up workspace on each incoming message, route to correct Notion token + DB IDs
- [ ] Docker Compose for self-hosted customers who want full control or their own private bot

## Phase 6 — Enrichment & Prospection Polish

- [ ] Prospection pipeline: batch enrich a list from CSV/LinkedIn export
- [ ] Dedup: merge duplicate People/Companies via LLM similarity
- [ ] Robustify enrichment for People and Companies: retry logic, partial-failure recovery, progress logging per record, idempotent runs (skip already-enriched records), dry-run mode that reports what would change
- [ ] Wire Prosper MCP once it's live (`~/lab_perso/prosper`, currently early-stage/not reliably up): re-promote it from optional accelerator back to the primary source in `skills/company-open-data-enrichment/SKILL.md` (`resolve_company`/`get_company`/`get_company_rne`/`get_company_dirigeants`/`enrich_company`), keep the direct-API fallback (SIREN/BODACC/RNE via `recherche-entreprises.api.gouv.fr` + `bodacc-datadila.opendatasoft.com`, added 2026-07-23) as the degraded path instead of the only path
- [x] Companies Finance section (`CA`/`Résultat net`/`Marge nette %`/`Année financière`) live-tested end-to-end: RTE, LCH, and all 13 other companies behind currently-open (non-Closed-Lost) leads with real RNE data, via the direct-Notion-API fallback (2026-07-24, see DECISIONS.md same date). PR #25 (doc-only) still open, not yet merged.
- [ ] Fix `notion_pilot/shared/siren_lookup.py::naf_section_to_sector()` — its output vocabulary (`"Public Sector"`, `"Energy"`, `"Finance"`, etc.) doesn't match the live Companies Sector select options (`"Government & Public Sector"`, `"Energy & Utilities"`, `"Financial Services"`, etc.); found 2026-07-24 while enriching CRE/Gasunie by hand. Either update the hardcoded mapping or read the DB's actual select options at runtime.
- [ ] Decide what to do about the Companies data source having no `Notes` property at all (found 2026-07-24) — the `company-open-data-enrichment` skill's BODACC/dirigeants `[open-data]` block assumes one exists. Either add the property (schema change, needs explicit `go`) or correct the skill doc.

## Later / Won't Do Now

- WhatsApp adapter
- Web clipper (browser extension)
- RSS feeds
- Multi-tenant SaaS billing (hard multi-tenancy, billing, subscription management)
- Support for knowledge bases other than Notion

## Now
<!-- added by ai-dotfiles upgrade -->

- **2026-07-22:** Project skill `notion-crm-ops` + Cursor `.cursor/mcp.json` for `notion-crm` stdio. Agent can create/update Leads & Activities via Notion MCP (preview-gated). Still open: wire `NOTION_DEALS_DATABASE_ID`/`NOTION_ACTIVITIES_DATABASE_ID` for stdio path; run skill evals.
- **PR #19 merged** (`mcp-crm-fixes` → `develop`, squash `af2d718`, 2026-07-16): fixed the People DB schema bug, the "Rte France"/"RTE" duplicate-creation bug, the SIREN accuracy gap, and the `matched_name` overwrite bug. See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) 2026-07-16 entry and `[[2026-07-16-mcp-crm-fixes]]`.
- **3 PRs open, not yet merged** (from `[[2026-07-16-mcp-people-knowledge-fixes-plan]]`): #20 (`upsert_companies` MCP thin-wrapper refactor + a second SIREN-gate fix on `upsert()`, see DECISIONS.md 2026-07-17 entry), #21 (`/people` markdown-link paste parsing), #22 (richer multi-link knowledge pages). See `[[2026-07-17-mcp-people-knowledge-fixes]]`.
- **New, found during PR #19's whole-branch review, not fixed in that PR:** `web/server.py`'s `/lead` and web-cockpit person-create path independently writes to the same wrong `"Nom"` property — same root cause, different code path. Needs its own fix.
- **Still open:** archive the stale, empty "Rte France" duplicate Notion page (`39e6c451-9465-81d1-ad4e-f80e58fc3070`) — PR #19 is merged now, so this just needs the live-test re-run + archive step (not yet done). Not the same pages as the "Ugent"/"Sqli" pages archived 2026-07-17.

## Next
<!-- added by ai-dotfiles upgrade -->

- MCP server (`notion_pilot/mcp/`) merged to `develop` 2026-07-15 (PR #18, squash commit `8e705b7`) — exposes CRM upsert/dedup/enrich/rank/read as 11 MCP tools. Registered in this repo's own `.claude/settings.json` as `notion-crm` (needs a Claude Code restart to connect). Still needs: verify the *sibling* `artelys-crystal-hpc-lead-generation` project's `.claude/settings.json` registration (added earlier, points at this repo's main checkout — the worktree it may have referenced is gone now that the branch merged) actually resolves.
- No MCP tool creates a Lead/Deal yet — only `upsert_people`/`upsert_companies` write, `get_open_leads` is read-only. Add if Deal creation via MCP is wanted.
